SpreeGiftCard [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jdutil/spree_gift_card.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jdutil/spree_gift_card) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/jdutil/spree_gift_card.png?travis)](https://gemnasium.com/jdutil/spree_gift_card)
=============

# Defaults to Â£ for all currency

This extension adds gift card functionality to spree.  It is based off the original [spree_gift_cards](http://github.com/spree/spree_gift_cards)
extension, but differs in that it does not require a user to have an account.  Gift cards may be redeemed by
entering a unique gift card code during checkout rather than applying store credits to the customers account.

Requirements
============

* Spree Core 1.1.0 or greater.
* Ruby 1.9.2 or greater.

Installation
============

1. Add `gem 'spree_gift_card', github: 'jdutil/spree_gift_card'` to Gemfile
1. Run `bundle`
1. Run `rails g spree_gift_card:install`
1. Run `rails g spree_gift_card:seed`

Testing
=======

1. bundle exec rake test_app
1. bundle exec rspec spec

Todo
====

1. Have spree_gift_card:install prompt to run spree_gift_card:seed and update installation instructions
1. Have new gift card page mimic styling of product page
1. Should have infinite gift card product stock.  Don't know of any current spree implementation for this (patch core?).
1. Should have the option of a default message as the first select option, such as "Select Amount"
1. Make form fields configurable like spree_contact_us
1. Should admin deletion just set a deleted_at column so gift card data is not lost?
1. test product controller redirect?
1. Apply gift code in a before filter if possible to avoid overriding the update method for easier upgrades?
